Timestamp: 2025-10-26T23:54:43.431270

EVALUATION OVERVIEW
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This report contains the complete evaluation of the trained GNN policy
against baseline Fast Downward planners on a test set of problems.

KEY FILES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Detailed results:     evaluation_results.csv
  Summary statistics:   evaluation_summary.json
  Comparison report:    comparison_report.txt
  Plots directory:      plots/

HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. SOLVE RATE: Percentage of problems solved by each planner
   - Higher is better. Target: > 80% for GNN on test set.

2. AVERAGE TIME: Mean solution time for solved problems
   - Lower is better. Measures computational efficiency.

3. EXPANSIONS: Mean number of nodes expanded during search
   - Lower is better. Indicates heuristic quality.

4. PLAN COST: Quality of solutions found
   - Lower is better. Indicates solution optimality.

5. EFFICIENCY FRONTIER: Trade-off between time and expansions
   - Curves closer to origin are better.

NEXT STEPS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Review the comparison_report.txt for baseline performance
2. Check plots/solve_rate_comparison.png for GNN vs baselines
3. Analyze per_problem_comparison.png for problem-specific insights
4. Review evaluation_summary.json for detailed statistics

INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ EXCELLENT: GNN solves >= 90% of problems with time comparable to LM-Cut
✓  GOOD:      GNN solves >= 80% of problems with reasonable time
⚠️  FAIR:      GNN solves >= 60% of problems, needs optimization
❌ POOR:      GNN solves < 60% of problems, requires retraining
